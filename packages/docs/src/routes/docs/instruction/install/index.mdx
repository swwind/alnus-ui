# Installation

## Install from NPM

Suppose you already have [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) installed, you just need to install `alnus-ui` package.

```bash
yarn add -D alnus-ui
```

After that, add following code to your `tailwind.config.js`.

```js
module.exports = {
  plugins: [require("alnus-ui")],
};
```

## Install from CDN

Add following lines in your HTML.

```html
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/alnus-ui/dist/base.css" />
<link rel="stylesheet" href="https://unpkg.com/alnus-ui/dist/components.css" />
```
